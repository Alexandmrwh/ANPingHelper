# ANPingHelper

The coarse example in ViewController.m shows how to ping each ip in one network segment.

If you want to use ANPingHelper, you only need to import ANPingHelperMarco.h, CommonUtils.h/.m and ANPingHeler.h/.m in your project.

This ping helper works fine in sub threads. If you want to ping a goup of ips, you should set the sendTimer to a proper interval.
